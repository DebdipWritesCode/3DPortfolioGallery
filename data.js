    description: `Code isn’t just logic — it’s a superpower to solve problems.
      From building AI tools as a Gen AI Intern at Banao, to delivering solutions as a Freelance Developer and Writer on Upwork, I’ve shipped real-world projects that make a difference.
      It’s not just code. It’s impact, at scale.`,

    title: "My DSA Journey: Patterns in Chaos",
    description: `I love that feeling when code just clicks — when chaos turns into clarity.
      Solving 450+ LeetCode problems has taught me that every bug is a lesson, every pattern is a puzzle, and every solution is an art form.
      Data structures? Algorithms? Let’s code.
      Alt + C if you want to see how I break down problems — one line at a time.`,

    description: `I didn’t just code — I built a community.
        Over a year as Co-Lead at Elevate, I guided 200+ students, organized 5+ workshops and hackathons, and turned ideas into impact.
        From brainstorming sessions to sleepless nights, I’ve seen firsthand how mentorship and collaboration can light the spark in future innovators.`,

    title: "My MUN Journey: Words that Build Worlds",
    description: `I believe words are as powerful as code.
        From the chambers of IITs to chairing conferences, my MUN journey has been a masterclass in discourse, diplomacy, and daring to speak up.
        2 Special Mentions, 1 Honorable Mention — and countless learnings that shaped how I think, lead, and collaborate.
        Got an idea you’re passionate about? Let’s talk.`,

    title: "My Masterpieces: A Glimpse",
    description: `These aren't just projects — they're experiments, solutions, and sometimes, late-night obsessions.
      From building this very 3D gallery, to crafting an AI that can solve LeetCode problems, to predicting cricket scores with machine learning — this wall holds a mix of the practical, the playful, and the purposeful.
      Each one taught me something new. Each one pushed me further.`,

    title: "My Education: Where It All Began",
    description: `IIIT Nagpur — the place that turned curiosity into code.
                  I'm doing my B.Tech in Computer Science here (2023–2027), and it's been more than just classes. From cracking DSA problems to losing sleep over AI models, this place gave me the tools and the hustle.
                  Also, yes — it’s an Institute of National Importance. Kinda proud of that.`,
